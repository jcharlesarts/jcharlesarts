- Hi, I’m @jcharlesarts
- I’m an artist and social studies teacher.
- I’m interested in building  educaitonal games for my students to experience history in a unique way. 
- I'm not a skilled dev but I'm using what I've got to make the most of my slipshod ideas.
- How to reach me: via github or instagram.
- Would love to collaborate to build better systems and continue learning.
